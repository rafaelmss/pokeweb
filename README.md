# PokeWeb

This is an implementation using ASP.NET in the Visual Studio 2015 IDE of a REST API under the context of Pokemon.

For the implementation we used the features of the Entity Framework for persistence and bank control, as well as Swagger for API testing.

In the documentation generation, Doxygen was used, with the ability to interpret the comments in the source code and generate the documentation in "latex" and "html".
